* What is this?
[[https://github.com/basho/basho_bench][basho_bench]] is Basho's most excellent key/value store benchmarking application. To ease comparison with the erlang riak client I wrote this simple shim between basho_bench and the [[https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client][riak-java-client]].

Running bench_shim allows you to benchmark riak with the riak-java-client (or benchmark the riak-java-client against Riak).

* Usage

You need Java and maven.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  git clone git://github.com/russelldb/bench_shim.git
  mvn clean install
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.basho.riak.bench.BenchShimApp" -Dexec.classpathScope=runtime -Dexec.args="nodename@host.local MY_COOKIE"
#+END_SRC

This will start a local Jinterface node. You then need to configure your basho_bench installation to talk to this Java node.

See the riakc_java.config file in the root of this repo for an example.

You will need *my* branch of basho_bench for the time being (I'll try and get it accepted into basho master). You can find it [[https://github.com/russelldb/basho_bench][here]].

* To do
Lots, this is just a starter that drives the PB client. 

1. HTTP/PB choice
2. Better docs
